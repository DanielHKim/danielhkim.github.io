<h1>Daniel Kim's Bio</h1>

- Born in New Jersey on 5 December 1993<br/>
- Lived in New Jersey, California, Oregon, and South Dakota (no particular order)<br/>
- Waited until senior year of high school to finally get a driver's license<br/>
- So when I tried out for my high school's swim team, I kid you not, I <br/>
took an entire 52 seconds to swim two laps in a 25 yard pool. It was horrendous.<br/>
Eventually I got it down to 28 seconds by my last season, so I guess it all <br/>
worked out in the end.<br/>
- Yeah this is a pretty short bio<br/>
